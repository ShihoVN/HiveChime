Deliverable no.1

The readme should be something that that a regular person could read. There shouldn't be so much code. You may refer to line numbers in a main file and ask me (or a CS-adroit customer) to comment various chunks in and out.

Move on to writing to text file rather than Terminal, and give clear instructions on where that file will be created. Then give instructions on how to read in that file using the analysis code.

The terminal output is readable, looks good.

Grade:4/5


Deliverables 2 and 3

You did a good job with the DB and UI aspects of the project. The thing missing from the DB deliverable was the table requested by the customer (columns for id, msg, runId). You had a good go at the artistic aspect of deliverable no.3, but I didn't see a co-opting/rewriting of code from openprocessing.org or similar to produce a truly artistic visualization -- rather you stayed pretty close to a literal visualization of what was going on.

Project presentation
This was very good. You told us who your main users were and showed us what you'd done well.
